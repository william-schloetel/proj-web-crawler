# Spider on a Leash
This project will implement a web crawler/parser in Python from scratch. The purpose behind it is nefarious: to extract cell-phone numbers from Craigslist postings (a bit of an *ice-nine* situation...).

## Humble Spider who's Hungry for Phone Numbers
A while back I was intrigued by how folks on Craigslist would "hide" their phone numbers like this:

**Eightzero5 29THREE 70six3**
or
**(8ONE8) nine three5 two987**

Who were they trying to obscure their numbers from? Hackers? An alphabet soup agency? The dyslexic or visually impaired?

Whatever their reasoning, they sure never foresaw this lil spider. This lil spider can sniff out any phone number obscured in a Craigslist post (he's still learning how to get past the reCAPTCHA--maybe a future update?)
